# reChord

## 

*What* will it do:
- Keep track of all your guitar compositions

*Who* will use it:
- Anyone that plays guitar
 
*Why* is this project of interest to me:
I play guitar a lot and sometimes come up with random 
chord progressions and songs which I forget 
after a little while. I want to be able to save
the random stuff I come up with without having to
write it down on a peice of paper every time.

As a user, I want to be able to:
- add a new song/composition/chord progression to my
inventory
- view a list of all the compositions I've saved
- view all the chords I use in a composition
- update my chords for any composition
- save my book and its contents
- load my book and its contents
